# ECOND Emulator

Emulator of the functionality of the ECOND

The basic functionality of the emulator is implemented within the SimpleEmulator directory.

The emulator is designed for the purpose of running with outputs from UVM (xcelium/simvision) saved into a csv file, with one line per clock cycle.

The notebook RunEmulatorComparisons.ipynb contains the necessary steps for loading the data, running the python emulator, and comparing the outputs
